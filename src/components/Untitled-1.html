It is the creator of the groundbreaking wearable, the “iBeat Emergency Watch”. Their watch is an everyday
smartwatch that tracks users' continuous heart activity. It also notifies users about any oncoming emergency.

For their heart-monitoring smartwatch, iBeat used TouchGFX to create an elegant watch face with a stunning, high
contrast, and user-friendly display.
<h4>Innovative Wearable That Saves Lives</h4>
iBeat’s innovative smartwatch continuously monitors and analyses users’ around-the-clock heart activity through
hypersensitive sensors. If an oncoming life-threatening emergency is detected, such as heart slowing or stopping, the
iBeat Emergency Watch instantly alerts the user.  The user's network will also be notified as well as emergency
responders if needed. As a result, the user receives immediate care which potentially saves the user’s life.

<blockquote>Many of our users are seniors and have deprecated vision. Because of this, we needed an elegant UI with
    sharp, easy-to-read graphics. As our device is also a Personal Emergency Response System (PERS), precision and
    usability were of critical importance. We modelled our UI on simplicity and style, as users must wear the watch all
    day and night. It’s beautiful and highly functional as a timepiece. However, in“emergency mode,” the device is
    direct, precise and extremely responsive.</blockquote>

<h4>Easy Development with TouchGFX</h4>
After searching for a software that met their requirements, iBeat found TouchGFX. The team appreciated the ease of
integrating TouchGFX’s state-of-the art graphics into the device. Another plus was the low MCU load, as it gave their
watch a longer battery life.
<blockquote>TouchGFX offers a highly performance optimized UI library, easy to use as a developer. The performance is
    critical as we have a high-end design that needs to run on tight wearable hardware constraints. Being able to
    accomplish that with development ease in relation to the SDK, documentation, toolchain, and support for our desired
    hardware was a big win for us.</blockquote>

timeframe.
